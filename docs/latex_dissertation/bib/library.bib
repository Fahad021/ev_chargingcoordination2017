abstract = {High penetrations of domestic electric vehicles (EVs) in U.K. low voltage (LV) networks may result in significant technical problems. This paper proposes an implementable, centralized control algorithm, currently being trialed in 9 U.K. residential LV networks, that uses limited information to manage EV charging points to mitigate these technical problems. Two real U.K. LV networks are used to quantify the potential impacts of different EV penetration levels and to demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the control algorithm (using different control cycles) for simultaneous thermal and voltage management. Monte Carlo simulations (adopting 1-min resolution data) are undertaken to cater for domestic and EV demand uncertainties. Results for these LV networks show that problems may occur for EV penetrations higher than 20{\%}. More importantly, they highlight that even for a 100{\%} penetration and control cycles of up to 10min, the control algorithm successfully mitigates problems on the examined LV networks. Crucially, to determine effects on the comfortofEV users, ametric is introduced and discussed. The results of different control settings are presented to analyze potential adaptations of the control strategy. Finally, a comparison with an optimization framework highlights that the proposed algorithm is as effective while using limited information.},

abstract = {Domestic photovoltaic generation can partially offset the electricity demand within an individual dwelling. The net demand may be readily estimated on an annual basis, but modelling its import and export with respect to time, is more complex. A key issue is that domestic electricity demand, particularly lighting, is significantly influenced by the outdoor light level, which of course also has a direct effect on photovoltaic generation. Thus, realistic time-step simulation of the net demand requires that the two components are modelled with respect to a common representation of the solar irradiance. This article presents the construction of an integrated model that provides data at a one-minute time resolution, built upon a fully validated high-resolution electricity demand model. An open-source software implementation of the integrated model in VBA within Microsoft Excel is described and is available for free download.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of information gap decision theory (IGDT) to help the distribution network operators (DNOs) in choosing the supplying resources for meeting the demand of their customers. The three main energy resources are pool market, distributed generations (DGs), and the bilateral contracts. In deregulated environment, the DNO is faced with many uncertainties associated to the mentioned resources which may not have enough information about their nature and behaviors. In such cases, the classical methods like probabilistic methods or fuzzy methods are not applicable for uncertainty modeling because they need some information about the uncertainty behaviors like probability distribution function (PDF) or their membership functions. In this paper, a decision making framework is proposed based on IGDT model to solve this problem. The uncertain parameters considered here, are as follows: price of electricity in pool market and demand of each bus. The robust strategy of DNO is determined to hedge him against the risk of increasing the total cost beyond what it is willing to pay. The effectiveness of the proposed tool is assessed and demonstrated by applying it on a large distribution network.},

abstract = {The paper develops a novel decentralized charging control strategy for large populations of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). We consider the situation where PEV agents are rational and weakly coupled via their operation costs. At an established Nash equilibrium, each of the PEV agents reacts optimally with respect to the average charging strategy of all the PEV agents. Each of the average charging strategies can be approximated by an infinite population limit which is the solution of a fixed point problem. The control objective is to minimize electricity generation costs by establishing a PEV charging schedule that fills the overnight demand valley. The paper shows that under certain mild conditions, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium that almost satisfies that goal. Moreover, the paper establishes a sufficient condition under which the system converges to the unique Nash equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated through various numerical examples.},

@article{Fazelpour2014,
abstract = {Widespread application of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as an important part of smart grids requires drivers and power grid constraints to be satisfied simultaneously. We address these two challenges with the presence of renewable energy and charging rate optimization in the current paper. First optimal sizing and siting for installation of a distributed generation (DG) system is performed through the grid considering power loss minimization and voltage enhancement. Due to its benefits, the obtained optimum site is considered as the optimum location for constructing a movie theater complex equipped with a PHEV parking lot. To satisfy the obtained size of DG, an on-grid hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is chosen. In the next set of optimizations, optimal sizing of the HRES is performed to minimize the energy cost and to find the best number of decision variables, which are the number of the system's components. Eventually, considering demand uncertainties due to the unpredictability of the arrival and departure times of the vehicles, time-dependent charging rate optimizations of the PHEVs are performed in 1 h intervals for the 24-h of a day. All optimization problems are performed using genetic algorithms (GAs). The outcome of the proposed optimization sets can be considered as design steps of an efficient grid-friendly parking lot of PHEVs. The results indicate a reduction in real power losses and improvement in the voltage profile through the distribution line. They also show the competence of the utilized energy delivery method in making intelligent time-dependent decisions in off-peak and on-peak times for smart parking lots. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the procurement of load shifting service by optimally scheduling the charging and discharging of PEVs in a decentralized fashion. We assume that the energy flow between PEVs and the grid is bidirectional, i.e., PEVs can also release energy back into the grid as distributed generation, which is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The optimal scheduling problem is then formulated as a mixed discrete programming (MDP) problem, which is NP-hard and extremely difficult to solve directly. To get over this difficulty, we propose a solvable approximation of the MDP problem by exploiting the shape feature of the base demand curve during the night, and develop a decentralized algorithm based on iterative water-filling. Our algorithm is decentralized in the sense that the PEVs compute locally and communicate with an aggregator. The advantages of our algorithm include reduction in computational burden and privacy preserving. Simulation results are given to show the performance of our algorithm.},

@article{Hu2016a,
abstract = {Electric vehicles can become integral parts of a smart grid, since they are capable of providing valuable services to power systems other than just consuming power. On the transmission system level, electric vehicles are regarded as an important means of balancing the intermittent renewable energy resources such as wind power. This is because electric vehicles can be used to absorb the energy during the period of high electricity penetration and feed the electricity back into the grid when the demand is high or in situations of insufficient electricity generation. However, on the distribution system level, the extra loads created by the increasing number of electric vehicles may have adverse impacts on grid. These factors bring new challenges to the power system operators. To coordinate the interests and solve the conflicts, electric vehicle fleet operators are proposed both by academics and industries. This paper presents a review and classification of methods for smart charging (including power to vehicle and vehicle-to-grid) of electric vehicles for fleet operators. The study firstly presents service relationships between fleet operators and other four actors in smart grids; then, modeling of battery dynamics and driving patterns of electric vehicles, charging and communications standards are introduced; after that, three control strategies and their commonly used algorithms are described; finally, conclusion and recommendations are made.},

abstract = {The share of renewable generation (RG) in the energy mix has seen constant growth in recent years. RG is volatile and not (fully) controllable. Consequently, the alignment of stochastic demand with supply, which is fundamental for ensuring grid stability, becomes more difficult. The utilization of demand side flexibility as well as RG portfolio design are attractive opportunities to avoid excessive investments in conventional power plants and costs for balancing power. This paper provides a comprehensive centralized scheduling model to exploit demand flexibility from residential devices. We analyze the monetary value of households for demand response (DR) by determining the potential of various current and possible available future end consumer devices to reduce generation costs of a flexibility aggregator in a microgrid with a large share of RG. Furthermore, we identify key characteristics affecting the value of demand flexibility and derive recommendations for an aggregator's RG portfolio structure. Our simulation results indicate that electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and storage heaters are the most promising devices for residential DR. Furthermore, we show that the potential of a device to directly utilize intermittent RG is largely influenced by the composition of the renewable energy source portfolio.},

abstract = {Alternative vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are becoming more popular. The batteries of these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are to be charged at home from a standard outlet or on a corporate car park. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Without coordination of the charging, the vehicles are charged instantaneously when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charging profile of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is computed by minimizing the power losses. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming.},

Simulations are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the technique on a test distribution network. The results of the method are also compared to those from a centralized control method whereby EV charging is controlled by a central controller.

abstract = {We propose a decentralized algorithm to optimally schedule electric vehicle (EV) charging. The algorithm exploits the elasticity of electric vehicle loads to fill the valleys in elec- tric load profiles. We first formulate the EV charging scheduling problem as an optimal control problem, whose objective is to im- pose a generalized notion of valley-filling, and study properties of optimal charging profiles.We then give a decentralized algorithm to iteratively solve the optimal control problem. In each iteration, EVs update their charging profiles according to the controlsignal broadcast by the utility company, and the utility company alters the control signal to guide their updates. The algorithm con- verges to optimal charging profiles (that are as “flat” as they can possibly be) irrespective of the specifications (e.g., maximum charging rate and deadline) of EVs, even if EVs do not neces- sarily update their charging profiles in every iteration, and use potentially outdated control signal when they update. Moreover, the algorithm only requires each EV solving its local problem, hence its implementation requires low computation capability. We also extend the algorithm to track a given load profile and to real-time implementation.},

abstract = {Researchers have proposed that fleets of plug-in hybrid vehicles could be used to perform ancillary services for the electric grid. In many of these studies, the vehicles are able to accrue revenue for performing these grid stabilization services, which would offset the increased purchase cost of plug-in hybrid vehicles. To date, all such studies have assumed a vehicle command architecture that allows for a direct and deterministic communication between the grid system operator and the vehicle. This work compares this direct, deterministic vehicle command architecture to an aggregative vehicle command architecture on the bases of the availability, reliability and value of vehicle-provided ancillary services. This research incorporates a new level of detail into the modeling of vehicle-to-grid ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time series ancillary services pricing, and a consideration of ancillary services reliability. Results show that including an aggregating entity in the command and contracting architecture can improve the scale and reliability of vehicle-to-grid ancillary services, thereby making vehicle-to-grid ancillary services more compatible with the current ancillary services market. However, the aggregative architecture has the deleterious effect of reducing the revenue accrued by plug-in vehicle owners relative to the default architectures. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) add significant load on the power grid as they become widespread. The characteristics of this extra load follow the patterns of people's driving behaviours. In particular, random parameters such as arrival time and charging time of the vehicles determine their expected charging demand profile from the power grid. In this paper, we first present a model for uncoordinated charging power demand of EVs based on a stochastic process and accordingly we characterize an EV's expected daily power demand profile. Next, we illustrate it for different charging time distributions through simulations. This gives us useful insights into the long-term planning for upgrading power systems' infrastructure to accommodate EVs. Then, we incorporate departure time as another random variable into this modelling and introduce an autonomous demand response (DR) technique to manage the EVs' charging demand. Our results show that, it is possible to accommodate a large number of EVs and achieve the same peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in daily aggregated power consumption of the grid as when there is no EV in the system. This peak value can be decreased further significantly when we add vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability in the system.},

abstract = {The re-emergence of battery electric vehicles presents a potentially vast flexible resource to the power system at a time when renewable generation is pushing the ability of power systems to respond to increased levels of variability in production. Large installed quantities of wind and solar power in certain systems will cause changes in the operation of conventional generators that, over time, will reduce the economic feasibility of cost-effective but inflexible forms of generation. This can be avoided if electric vehicles can be used to mitigate the overall level of system variability by charging at times when production by conventional generators is at its lowest. This paper presents a methodology for determining the degree to which electric vehicles will influence future generation plant investment and a means of calculating the reduction in total system costs owing to the presence of optimally charged electric vehicles. This model is applied to a test system based on the state of Texas. It is found that the long-term benefits of electric vehicles are significant and continue to increase for all vehicle penetration levels studied. However, the relationship between levels of installed variable renewables and electric vehicle benefit was found to be highly dependent on the extent to which both of these parameters influenced the least-cost plant portfolio.},

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are emerging as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to conventional vehicles driven by internal combustion engines. However, uncoordinated charging of a large number of PEVs may cause grid failure. Therefore, charge scheduling of PEVs is an important problem. However, the charge scheduling by a single aggregator does not scale well as the PEV population grows. We propose a distributed framework for efficient PEV charging with multiple aggregators in a city where a PEV raises its charging request to a specific aggregator, and each aggregator has partial information about others. The aggregators collaborate among themselves for scheduling PEVs for charging in different charging stations owned by it or others. In this paper, we formulate a bi-objective charge scheduling optimization problem that attempts to maximize the total profit of the aggregators while maximizing the total number of PEVs charged. We first prove that the problem is NP-complete. We then propose distributed offline and online algorithms to solve the problem, and present simulation results for some realistic traffic scenarios.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyse the factors determining household car travel, and specifically the effects of household income and the prices of cars and motor fuels, and to explore the intertemporal pattern of adjustment. The question of asymmetry in the response to rising and falling income is also addressed. Such asymmetry may be caused by habit or resistance to change or the tendency to acquire habits to consume more easily than to abandon them. The impact of prices, the speed of adjustment and the resistance to change will be important in determining the possibility of influencing travel behaviour and specifically car use. The study utilises repeated cross-section data from the annual UK Family Expenditure Surveys and employs a pseudo-panel methodology. The results are compared with those for car ownership estimated on the basis of similar models. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study establishes a new approach to analyzing the economic impacts of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) regulation by simulating the restrictions arising from un- predictable mobility requests by vehicle users. A case study for Germany using average daily values (in the following also called the static approach) and a dynamic simulation including different mobility use patterns are presented. Comparing the dynamic approach with the static approach reveals a significant difference in the power a vehicle can offer for regulation and provides insights into the necessary size of vehicle pools and the possible adaptations required in the regulation market to render V2G feasible. In a first step, the regulation of primary, secondary and tertiary control is ana- lyzed based on previous static methods used to investigate V2G and data from the four German regulation areas. It is shown that negative secondary control is economically the most beneficial for electric vehicles because it offers the high- est potential for charging with low-priced energy from negative regulation. In a second step, a new method based on a Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic mobility behavior is applied to look at the negative secondary control market in more detail. Our simulation indicates that taking dynamic driving behavior into account results in a 40{\%} reduction of the power available for regulation. Be- cause of the high value of power in the regulation market this finding has a strong impact on the resulting revenues. Further, we demonstrate that, for the data used, a pool size of 10,000 vehicles seems reasonable to balance the var- iation in driving behavior of each individual. In the case of the German regula- tion market, which uses monthly bids, a daily or hourly bid period is recom- mended. This adaptation would be necessary to provide individual regulation assuming that the vehicles are primarily used for mobility reasons and cannot deliver the same amount of power every hour of the week.},

abstract = {The power system and transportation sector are our planet's main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy sources (RESs), mainly wind and solar, can reduce emissions from the electric energy sector; however, they are very intermittent. Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants) and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commit- ment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the fore- casted one. Thus, UC with plug-in vehicles under uncertainty in a smart grid is very complex considering smart charging and dis- charging to and from various energy sources and loads to reduce both cost and emissions. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources, load and GVs. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the expected cost and emissions of the UC schedule for the set of scenarios. Results are presented indicating that the smart grid has the potential to maximally utilize RESs and GVs to reduce cost and emissions from the power system and transportation sector.},

A representative of the substation operates the system and aims to minimize the cost of all phases and to balance loads among phases. We first consider ideal energy storage with lossless charging and discharging, and propose both centralized and distributed real-time algorithms taking into account system uncertainty. The proposed algorithm does not require any system statistics and asymptotically achieves the minimum system cost with large energy storage. We then extend the algorithm to accommodate more realistic non-ideal energy storage that has imperfect charging and discharging. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulation and compared with that of a benchmark greedy algorithm. Simulation shows that our algorithm leads to strong performance over a wide range of storage characteristics.},

The results showed that the coordinated charging of PHEVs could be beneficial to the DSOs to reduce distribution losses, and to improve voltage profiles and load factor, while on the other hand, the uncoordinated charging leads to more losses and increased peak load despite yielding optimized energy costs for the PHEV owners.},

abstract = {This paper describes the extension of CREST's existing electrical domestic demand model into an integrated thermal-electrical demand model. The principle novelty of the model is its integrated structure such that the timing of thermal and electrical output variables are appropriately correlated. The model has been developed primarily for low-voltage network analysis and the model's ability to account for demand diversity is of critical importance for this application. The model, however, can also serve as a basis for modelling domestic energy demands within the broader field of urban energy systems analysis. The new model includes the previously published components associated with electrical demand and generation (appliances, lighting, and photovoltaics) and integrates these with an updated occupancy model, a solar thermal collector model, and new thermal models including a low-order building thermal model, domestic hot water consumption, thermostat and timer controls and gas boilers. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in high-resolution domestic demand modelling, describes the model, and compares its output with three independent validation datasets. The integrated model remains an open-source development in Excel VBA and is freely available to download for users to configure and extend, or to incorporate into other models.},

abstract = {Renewable energy and Electric Vehicles (EV) show potential to be promising solutions for energy cost saving and emission reduction. However, the integration of renewable energy generation into the electric grid can be difficult, because of the source intermittency and inconsistency with energy usage. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating energy from renewable sources to EVs in an energy efficient manner. We assume that the renewable energy supply is time variant and possibly unpredictable. EVs' charging requests should be satisfied within a specified time frame, which may incur a cost of drawing extra energy (possibly non-renewable energy) if the renewable energy supply is not sufficent to meet the deadlines and may also reduce energy efficiency. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem based on queueing model to minimize the time average cost of using other energy sources (and hence make most usage of the renewable energy source). The proposed approach fully considers the individual charging rate limit and deadline of each EV. The Lyapunov optimization technique is used to solve the problem. The developed dynamic control algorithm does not require knowledge of the statistics of the time-varying renewable energy generation, EV charging demand process, or extra energy pricing.},

abstract = {Although electric vehicles are considered a viable solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their uncoordinated charging could have adverse effects on power system operation. Nevertheless, the task of optimal electric vehicle charging scales unfavorably with the fleet size and the number of control periods, especially when distribution grid limitations are enforced. To this end, vehicle charging is first tackled using the recently revived Frank-Wolfe method. The novel decentralized charging protocol has minimal computational requirements from vehicle controllers, enjoys provable acceleration over existing alternatives, enhances the security of the pricing mechanism against data attacks, and protects user privacy. To comply with voltage limits, a network-constrained EV charging problem is subsequently formulated. Leveraging a linearized model for unbalanced distribution grids, the goal is to minimize the power supply cost while respecting critical voltage regulation and substation capacity limitations. Optimizing variables across grid nodes is accomplished by exchanging information only between neighboring buses via the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical tests corroborate the optimality and efficiency of the novel schemes.},

These flexibilities include emission reduction, cost reduction, controlling financial risks, mitigating volatility of power output in renewable energy resources, active demand side management and ancillary service provision. In this chapter a comprehensive risk hedging model for energy hub management is proposed. The focus is placed on minimizing both the energy procurement cost and financial risks in energy hub. For controlling the undesired effects of the uncertainties, the Information gap decision theory (IGDT) technique is used as the risk management tool. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).

abstract = {The past decade has seen considerable theoretical and applied research on Markov decision processes, as well as the growing use of these models in ecology, economics, communications engineering, and other fields where outcomes are uncertain and sequential decision-making processes are needed. A timely response to this increased activity, Martin L. Puterman's new work provides a uniquely up-to-date, unified, and rigorous treatment of the theoretical, computational, and applied research on Markov decision process models. It discusses all major research directions in the field, highlights many significant applications of Markov decision processes models, and explores numerous important topics that have previously been neglected or given cursory coverage in the literature. Markov Decision Processes focuses primarily on infinite horizon discrete time models and models with discrete time spaces while also examining models with arbitrary state spaces, finite horizon models, and continuous-time discrete state models. The book is organized around optimality criteria, using a common framework centered on the optimality (Bellman) equation for presenting results. The results are presented in a "theorem-proof" format and elaborated on through both discussion and examples, including results that are not available in any other book. A two-state Markov decision process model, presented in Chapter 3, is analyzed repeatedly throughout the book and demonstrates many results and algorithms. Markov Decision Processes covers recent research advances in such areas as countable state space models with average reward criterion, constrained models, and models with risk sensitive optimality criteria. It also explores several topics that have received little or no attention in other books, including modified policy iteration, multichain models with average reward criterion, and sensitive optimality.

This paper presents a hierarchical control algorithm to realize this synergy by integrating the PEV charging and wind power scheduling. The control algorithm consists of three levels: the top-level controller optimizes the scheduling for the conventional power plants and wind power; the middle-level controller plans PEV charging to achieve load following based on the battery state of charge and plug-off time of each vehicle; the bottom-level controller uses grid electricity frequency as the feedback cue to control PEV charging and serves as the ancillary service to the grid. Numerical simulations show that the integrated controller can improve the grid frequency regulation and overall electricity generation cost without sacrificing the PEVs charging completion.},

In order to see the influence of different charging behaviours of PHEVs in the MG, three different charging patterns including uncontrolled, controlled and smart charging schemes are investigated. To study the optimal operation of the MG including the natural stochastic behaviour of the uncertain parameters, a new robust and powerful SOS (Symbiotic Organisms Search) algorithm is applied too. SOS simulates the interactions observed among natural organisms relying on other organisms to survive. In addition, a new modified version of the SOS algorithm is suggested to increase its total search ability in the local and global searches successfully. The performance of the proposed method is examined on two typical MG test systems with different scheduling time horizons. The results of applying the proposed method on the case studies are compared to other algorithms in different conditions with and without the PHEV charging effects.},

Modern battery management systems (BMS) provide a driver for a number of important indications, such as remaining operation time, remaining charge and power. Therefore, BMS is a key element of PEV. However, the performance of the batteries deteriorates during the cycle life, in particular the capacity fades and impedance grows, leading to a decrease in battery power. BMS may decrease these negative effects without creating inconvenience for the end-user. A number of advanced battery charging algorithms were developed in the recent decade. These algorithms can significantly improve the performance of PEV facilitating their mass production.},

abstract = {As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for "vehicle-to-grid" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power - the constant round-the-clock electricity supply - because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10{\%} of electric cost - {\$} 12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to power systems has impacts on the stability characteristics of the integrated systems. Wide area controllers (WACs) are used in power systems to provide auxiliary control signals to the generators or other devices in order to improve the stability of the system. The necessity of WACs becomes more relevant during grid-to-vehicle (G2V) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power transactions, that is, charging and discharging cycles of the PEVs respectively. The design of a WAC for providing damping to three generators in a 12-bus power system with PEVs is presented in this study. Each WAC signal is obtained based on the aggregation of modulated local and remote power system stabilisers' signals. The modulation indices associated with those signals are tuned using the particle swarm optimisation technique to provide the maximum damping to the three generators. The 12-bus power system with the PEVs and WAC has been implemented on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Typical results have been presented to show the improvement in the stability of the power system when PEVs are integrated using transient simulations and Prony analysis.},

abstract = {Previous work has shown that it could be profitable on some control markets to use Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as control power resources. This concept, where battery driven vehicles such as PHEVs provide ancillary service to the grid is commonly referred to as Vehicle to Grid (V2G). The idea is to sell the capacity and energy of the parked PHEVs on the control market. Due to the fact that cars on average are parked 92{\%} of the day, the availability of this capacity could be very high, even though it will be highly dependent on commuting patterns in peak hours. However, as each PHEV has a very small capacity from a grid perspective, it is necessary to implement an aggregating control system, managing a large number of vehicles. This paper presents strategies for an Aggregator to fulfill control bids on the German control markets. These strategies are tested with respect to reliability, efficiency and profitability in a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model is based on available data on the distributions of commuting departure times and travel distances, as well as average driving power consumption, PHEV battery capacities and the market constraints of the secondary control market in Germany.},

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {Abstract Electric vehicles (EVs) represent one of the most promising technologies to green the transportation systems. An important issue is that high penetration of EVs brings heavy electricity demand to the power grid. One effective way to alleviate the impact is to integrate local power generation such as renewable energy sources (RESs) into charging infrastructure. Because of the intermittent and indispatchable nature of RESs, it becomes very challenging to coordinate EVs charging with other grid load and renewable generation. In this paper, EVs charging problem in the presence of smart grid technologies is investigated, and the interaction with renewable energy is reviewed. An overview about EVs and RESs is first presented, which mainly introduces major types of EVs and renewable energy estimation methods. Then, according to the objectives, the existing research works are divided into three categories: cost-aware, efficiency-aware, and emissions-aware interactions between EVs and RESs. Each category's discussion includes the description of core ideas, summarization of solutions, and comparison between different works. Finally, some key open issues about EVs interacting with RESs are given and some possible solutions are also discussed.},

@article{Dallinger2011,
abstract = {This study establishes a new approach to analyzing the economic impacts of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) regulation reserves by simulating the restrictions arising from unpredictable mobility requests by vehicle users. A case study for Germany using average daily values (in the following also called the {\&}{\#}x201C;static{\&}{\#}x201D; approach) and a dynamic simulation including different mobility use patterns are presented. Comparing the dynamic approach with the static approach reveals a significant difference in the power a vehicle can offer for ancillary services and provides insights into the necessary size of vehicle pools and possible adaptations required in the regulation market to render V2G feasible. In the static approach it is shown that negative secondary control is economically the most beneficial for electric vehicles because it offers the highest potential for charging with {\&}{\#}x201C;low-priced{\&}{\#}x201D; energy from negative regulation reserves. A Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic mobility behavior results in a 40{\%} reduction of the power available for regulation compared to the static approach. Because of the high value of power in the regulation market, this finding has a strong impact on the resulting revenues. Further, we demonstrate that, for the data used, a pool size of 10{\&}{\#}x2009;000 vehicles seems reasonable to balance the variation in each individual's driving behavior. In the case of the German regulation market, which uses monthly bids, a daily or hourly bid period is recommended. This adaptation would be necessary to provide individual regulation assuming that the vehicles are primarily used for mobility reasons and cannot deliver the same amount of power every hour of the week.},

abstract = {The vehicle electrification will have a significant impact on the power grid due to the increase in electricity consumption. It is important to perform intelligent scheduling for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). However, there are two major challenges in the scheduling problem. First, it is challenging to find the globally optimal scheduling solution which can minimize the total cost. Second, it is difficult to find a distributed scheduling scheme which can handle a large population and the random arrivals of the EVs. In this paper, we propose a globally optimal scheduling scheme and a locally optimal scheduling scheme for EV charging and discharging. We first formulate a global scheduling optimization problem, in which the charging powers are optimized to minimize the total cost of all EVs which perform charging and discharging during the day. The globally optimal solution provides the globally minimal total cost. However, the globally optimal scheduling scheme is impractical since it requires the information on the future base loads and the arrival times and the charging periods of the EVs that will arrive in the future time of the day. To develop a practical scheduling scheme, we then formulate a local scheduling optimization problem, which aims to minimize the total cost of the EVs in the current ongoing EV set in the local group. The locally optimal scheduling scheme is not only scalable to a large EV population but also resilient to the dynamic EV arrivals. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the locally optimal scheduling scheme can achieve a close performance compared to the globally optimal scheduling scheme.},

Nonlinear optimization has been used to solve the social welfare optimization problem in order to obtain the DLMPs. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by using the bus 4 distribution system of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and Danish driving data. The case study results show that the integrated DLMP methodology can successfully alleviate the congestion caused by EV loads. It is also shown that the socially optimal charging schedule can be implemented through a decentralized mechanism where loads respond autonomously to the posted DLMPs by maximizing their individual net surplus.},

abstract = {Advances in the development of electric vehicles, along with policy incentives will see a wider uptake of this technology in the transport sector in future years. However, the widespread implementation of electric vehicles could lead to adverse effects on power system networks, especially existing distribution networks. This work investigates some of the potential impacts from various levels of uncontrolled electric vehicle charging on a test distribution network. The network is examined under worst case scenario conditions for residential electricity demand in an effort to assess the full impact from electric vehicles. The results demonstrate that even for relatively modest levels of electric vehicle charging, both the voltage and thermal loading levels can exceed safe operating limits. The results also indicate the importance of assessing each phase on the network separately in order to capture the full effects of uncontrolled electric vehicle charging on the network.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the optimal scheduling of electric power units in the renewable based local distribution systems considering plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The appearance of PEVs in the electric grid can create new challenges for the operation of distributed generations and power units inside the network. In order to deal with this issue, a new stochastic optimization method is devised to let the central controll manage the power units and charging behavior of PEVs. The problem formulation aims to minimize the total cost of the network including the cost of power supply for loads and PEVs as well as the cost of energy not supplied (ENS) as the reliability costs. In order to make PEVs as opportunity for the grid, the vehicle-2-grid (V2G) technology is employed to reduce the operational costs. To model the high uncertain behavior of wind turbine, photovoltaics and the charging and discharging pattern of PEVs, a new stochastic power flow based on unscented transform is proposed. Finally, a new optimization algorithm based on bat algorithm (BA) is proposed to solve the problem optimally. The satisfying performance of the proposed stochastic method is tested on a grid-connected local distribution system.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles could potentially provide valued services to the power grid when not being driven, reducing ownership costs. This project evaluated the feasibility and practicality of vehicles providing a grid ancillary service called regulation. Regulation is especially well suited to battery electric vehicles: it involves fast-response changes in power above and below a baseline. With the baseline set at zero power, the power fluctuations above and below zero average out to approximately zero net energy over time. Hence, a vehicle{\~{O}}s battery state of charge would vary in the short term, but would not become discharged over time. A test vehicle was fitted with a bidirectional grid power interface and wireless internet connectivity, allowing power flow to or from the vehicle to be dispatched remotely. An {\^{O}}aggregator{\~{O}} function was developed to represent a commercial middleman between a grid operator and multiple vehicles. Power dispatch commands were sent wirelessly to the vehicle at 4-second intervals, and the vehicle response was monitored and recorded. Results showed that wireless data transmission times were within ISO system requirements, and that the energy throughput through the battery due to regulation is similar to that of typical daily driving. The value created by the service exceeds the battery wear out costs under most operating assumptions. The long term effects on battery life were beyond the scope of the study; however it was noted that battery capacity increased by about 10 percent during the testing.},

abstract = {This paper addresses issues concerning the integration of single-phase charging devices for electric vehicles (EV) in low-voltage microgrids. Fast release energy storage is a key issue for microgrid islanding operation. EV batteries provide an additional storage capacity, which can now be exploited in order to improve MG islanding. Aiming to do so, different control strategies were developed and tested: (1) a local control approach where no communication link is required and (2) a centralized charging control solution. The local control approach is based on the measuring of EV terminal voltage and frequency in order to define the charging or discharging rates of the batteries. The centralized control strategy allows balancing single-phase loads connected to the microgrid by adapting the charging rates of the EV storage devices. Simulation results show that EV batteries can actively contribute for voltage balancing and frequency control during islanding operating conditions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Operational flexibility is an important property of electric power systems. The term flexibility is widely used in the context of power systems although at times without a proper definition. The role of operational flexibility for the transition of existing power systems, many of them based on fossil fuels, towards power systems effectively accommodating high shares of variable Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has been widely recognized. Availability of sufficient operational flexibility is a necessary precondition for the grid integration of large shares of power in-feed from variable RES, for example wind power and photovoltaics (PV). The paper analyzes the role of operational flexibility in power systems. Necessary flexibility metrics for categorizing different types of operational flexibility are discussed. A new methodology for assessing the technically available operational flexibility is presented. Qualitative insights are derived, notably regarding the limits of RES integration for a given power system with its specific flexibility properties. An extensive simulation study is performed, assessing the role that operational flexibility has for the mitigation of challenges, namely curtailment, arising from high shares of variable RES in-feed.

abstract = {In the literature electric vehicle use is modelled using of a variety of approaches in power systems, energy and environmental analyses as well as in travel demand analysis. This paper provides a systematic review of these diverse approaches using a twofold classification of electric vehicle use representation, based on the time scale and on substantive differences in the modelling techniques. For time of day analysis of demand we identify activity-based modelling (ABM) as the most attractive because it provides a framework amenable for integrated cross-sector analyses, required for the emerging integration of the transport and electricity network. However, we find that the current examples of implementation of AMB simulation tools for EV-grid interaction analyses have substantial limitations. Amongst the most critical there is the lack of realism how charging behaviour is represented.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are important components of the smart grid (SG) for their capability of providing better ancillary services and facilitating the adoption of renewable resources. The operation of the V2G networks is based on continuously monitoring the status of individual battery vehicle (BV) as well as a carefully designed incentive scheme to attract sufficient participating BVs. However, the close monitoring tends to raise privacy concerns from the BV owners about identity and location information leakage, which have not been considered in previous works. In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify the privacy-preserving issues and propose a precise reward scheme in V2G networks, both of which are important towards bringing the concept of V2G network into practice. In V2G networks, it is the service providers (individual BVs) who need privacy protection rather than the service consumer (power grid). This unique characteristic renders privacy protection solutions proposed for conventional network systems not directly applicable. To protect privacy of BVs in V2G networks, we present , a secure communication architecture which achieves privacy-preserving for both BVs' monitoring and rewarding processes. Extensive performance analysis shows that only incurs moderate communication and computational overheads.},

abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are a midterm solution to reduce the transportation sector's dependency on oil. However, if implemented in a large scale without control, peak load increases significantly and the grid may be overloaded. Two algorithms to address this problem are proposed and analyzed. Both are based on a forecast of future electricity prices and use dynamic programming to find the economically optimal solution for the vehicle owner. The first optimizes the charging time and energy flows. It reduces daily electricity cost substantially without increasing battery degradation. The latter also takes into account vehicle to grid support as a means of generating additional profits by participating in ancillary service markets. Constraints caused by vehicle utilization as well as technical limitations are taken into account. An analysis, based on data of the California independent system operator, indicates that smart charge timing reduces daily electricity costs for driving from {\$}0.43 to {\$}0.2. Provision of regulating power substantially improves plug-in hybrid electric vehicle economics and the daily profits amount to {\$}1.71, including the cost of driving.},

abstract = {In this monograph, we present an overview and analysis of the possible approaches to bringing an active demand side into electricity markets. In section I, we describe the ways in which economic incentives can be introduced on the demand side.  We discuss the fundamental economics of establishing these incentives and the economic loss from systems that lack demand-side participation, and we analyze the effect of these incentives on the efficiency and competitiveness of the market. In section II, we move from the fundamentals to specific issues of implementing time-varying prices.  We begin by describing illustrative Realtime Pricing and Critical Peak Pricing tariffs that are in use today.  We then address the actual development of dynamic retail prices. In section III, we examine the ways in which customers respond to time-varying and dynamic prices.  We discuss both the potential responses that are envisioned by those who study optimization of power use and the actual responses that have taken place in pilot and long-term programs.  We conclude in section IV by advocating much wider use of dynamic retail pricing, under which prices faced by end-use customers can be adjusted frequently and on short notice to reflect changes in wholesale prices and the supply/demand balance.   },

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles, whether fueled by batteries or by liquid or gaseous fuels generating electricity on-board, will have value to electric utilities as power resources. The power capacity of the current internal combustion passenger vehicle fleet is enormous and under-utilized. In the United States, for example, the vehicle fleet has over 10 times the mechanical power of all current U.S. electrical generating plants and is idle over 95{\%} of the day. Electric utilities could use battery vehicles as storage, or fuel cell and hybrid vehicles as generation. This paper analyzes vehicle battery storage in greatest detail, comparing three electric vehicle configurations over a range of driving requirements and electric utility demand conditions. Even when making unfavorable assumptions about the cost and lifetime of batteries, over a wide range of conditions the value to the utility of tapping vehicle electrical storage exceeds the cost of the two-way hook-up and reduced vehicle battery life. For example, even a currently-available electric vehicle, in a utility with medium value of peak power, could provide power at a net present cost to the vehicle owner of {\$}955 and net present value to the utility of {\$}2370. As an incentive to the vehicle owner, the utility might offer a vehicle purchase subsidy, lower electric rates, or purchase and maintenance of successive vehicle batteries. For a utility tapping vehicle power, the increased storage would provide system benefits such as reliability and lower costs, and would later facilitate large-scale integration of intermittent-renewable energy resources.},

abstract = {The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that need to be addressed. In the near future, a large number of PHEVs in our society will add a large-scale energy load to our power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station. The authors used the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to intelligently allocate electrical energy to the PHEVs connected to the grid. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given. The authors considered real-world constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. The authors also simulated the real-world parking deck scenarios according to the statistical analysis based on the transportation data. The authors characterized the performance of EDA using a Matlab simulation, and compared it with other optimization techniques.},

abstract = {This paper explores both the promise and the possible pitfalls of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept, focusing first on its definition and then on its technical state-of-the-art. More originally, the paper assesses significant, though often overlooked, social barriers to the wider use of PHEVs (a likely precursor to V2G) and implementation of a V2G transition. The article disputes the idea that the only important barriers facing the greater use of PHEVs and V2G systems are technical. Instead, it provides a broader assessment situating such "technical" barriers alongside more subtle impediments relating to social and cultural values, business practices, and political interests. The history of other energy transitions, and more specifically the history of renewable energy technologies, implies that these "socio-technical" obstacles may be just as important to any V2G transition-and perhaps even more difficult to overcome. Analogously, the article illuminates the policy implications of such barriers, emphasizing what policymakers need to achieve a transition to a V2G and PHEV world. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The electrification of the vehicle fleet will result in an additional load on the power grid. Adequately dealing with such pluggable (hybrid) electrical vehicles (PHEV) forms part of the challenges and opportunities in the evolution towards Smart Grids. In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of using control mechanisms, that could be offered by a Home Energy control box, in optimizing energy consumption stemming from PHEV charging in a residential use case. We present smart energy control strategies based on quadratic programming for charging PHEVs, aiming to minimize the peak load and flatten the overall load profile. We compare two strategies, and benchmark them against a business-as-usual scenario assuming full charging starting upon plugging in the PHEV. The first, local strategy only uses information at the home where the PHEV is charged: as a result the charging is optimized for local loads. The local strategy is compared to a global iterative strategy which controls the charging of multiple vehicles based on global load information over a residential area. Both strategies control the duration and rate of charging and result in charging schedules for each vehicle. We present quantitative simulation results over a set of 150 homes, and discuss the strategies in terms of complexity and performance (esp. resulting energy consumption), as well as their requirements concerning infrastructure and communication.},

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can be considered flexible loads, as the time when they are charged can be shifted to a certain extent without impacting the drivers' mobility. An aggregator coordinating these flexible resources aims to minimize the costs of charging, subject to individual PEV constraints, imposed by battery and charging infrastructure characteristics, as well as driving patterns. Since driving behavior cannot be perfectly forecasted, this problem is stochastic. In this paper, we propose a decentralized control algorithm to coordinate charging, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In this setup, the aggregator and PEVs find the global solution by individually solving local optimization problems. The solution is found iteratively, whereby information between the PEVs and the aggregator is exchanged at each iteration. When the objective function of the charging optimization problem and the PEV constraints are convex, the algorithm converges to the global optimum. To take driving behavior uncertainty into account, the scheme considers several scenarios of driving patterns for each vehicle. A receding time horizon optimization is used, whereby at each new stage the representation of the fleet is updated with new scenarios consistent with the current observations. The local optimization problems, which can be solved very fast, could be solved in parallel for each PEV and scenario using decentralized computing, making the approach suitable for large-scale problems. A numerical example shows how this method can be applied to flatten the system load.},

abstract = {Assessing the impact of domestic low-carbon technologies on the electricity distribution network requires a detailed insight into the operation of networks and the power demands of consumers. When used on a wide-scale, low-carbon technologies, including domestic scale micro-generation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and flexible demand, will change the nature of domestic electricity use. In providing a basis for the quantification of the impact upon distribution networks, this thesis details the construction and use of a high-resolution integrated model that simulates both existing domestic electricity use and low voltage distribution networks. Electricity demand is modelled at the level of individual household appliances and is based upon surveyed occupant time-use data. This approach results in a simulation that exhibits realistic time-variant demand characteristics, in both individual dwellings, as well as, groups of dwellings together. Validation is performed against real domestic electricity use data, measured for this purpose, from dwellings in Loughborough in the East Midlands, UK. The low voltage distribution network is modelled using real network data, and the output of its simulation is validated against measured network voltages and power demands. The integrated model provides a highly detailed insight into the operation of networks at a one-minute resolution. This integrated model is the main output of this research, alongside published articles and a freely downloadable software implementation of the demand model.},

Different degrees of continuous discharge were imposed on the cells to mimic afternoon V2G use to displace grid electricity. The loss of battery capacity was quantified as a function of driving days as well as a function of integrated capacity and energy processed by the cells. The cells tested showed promising capacity fade performance: more than 95{\%} of the original cell capacity remains after thousands of driving days worth of use. Statistical analyses indicate that rapid vehicle motive cycling degraded the cells more than slower, V2G galvanostatic cycling.

abstract = {This paper studies risk-aware day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatch for electric vehicle (EV) charging, aiming to jointly optimize the EV charging cost and the risk of the load mismatch between the forecast and the actual EV loads, due to the random driving activities of EVs. It turns out that the consideration of the load mismatch risk in the objective function significantly complicates the risk-aware day-ahead scheduling problem (indeed it involves nonconvex optimization). A key step taken here is to utilize a hidden convexity structure to recast this problem as a two-stage stochastic linear program, and then solve it by using the L-shaped method. Since the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of EVs, an estimation algorithm is developed based on importance sampling to mitigate the computational complexity. Further, a distributed risk-aware real-time dispatch algorithm is developed, in which the aggregator needs to compute only the shadow prices for each EV to optimize its own charging strategy in a distributed manner. It is shown, based on real data, that the proposed risk-aware day-ahead scheduling algorithm using importance sampling can significantly reduce the overall charging cost with a small number of samples.},

abstract = {Unit commitment (UC) is an optimization problem used to determine the operation schedule of the generating units at every hour interval with varying loads under different constraints and environments. Many algorithms have been invented in the past five decades for optimization of the UC problem, but still researchers are working in this field to find new hybrid algorithms to make the problem more realistic. The importance of UC is increasing with the constantly varying demands. There- fore, there is an urgent need in the power sector to keep track of the latest methodologies to further optimize the working criterions of the generating units. This paper focuses on providing a clear review of the latest techniques employed in optimizing UC problems for both stochastic and deterministic loads, which has been acquired from many peer reviewed published papers. It has been divided into many sections which include various constraints based on profit, security, emission and time. It emphasizes not only on deregulated and regulated environments but also on renewable energy and distributed generating systems. In terms of contributions, the detailed analysis of all the UC algorithms has been discussed for the benefit of new researchers interested in working in this field},

This paper presents a high-resolution model of domestic electricity use that is based upon a combination of patterns of active occupancy (i.e. when people are at home and awake), and daily activity profiles that characterise how people spend their time performing certain activities. One-min resolution synthetic electricity demand data is created through the simulation of appliance use; the model covers all major appliances commonly found in the domestic environment. In order to validate the model, electricity demand was recorded over the period of a year within 22 dwellings in the East Midlands, UK. A thorough quantitative comparison is made between the synthetic and measured data sets, showing them to have similar statistical characteristics. A freely downloadable example of the model is made available and may be configured to the particular requirements of users or incorporated into other models. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is essential to estimate how much power can be delivered from vehicles to grid, called achievable power capacity (APC), for practical vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. We propose a method of estimating the APC in a probabilistic manner. Its probability distribution is obtained from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and hence represented with two parameters, i.e., mean and covariance. Based on the probability distribution of the APC, we calculate the power capacity that V2G regulation providers (or V2G aggregators) are contracted to provide grid operators with, called the contracted power capacity (CPC). Four possible contract types between a grid operator and a V2G regulation provider are suggested and, for each contract type, a profit function is developed from the APC and the penalty imposed to the V2G aggregator. The CPCs for four contract types are chosen to maximize the corresponding profit functions. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the estimated probability distribution of APC and the effectiveness of the profit functions.},

abstract = {Chargeable electric vehicles are projected to gain increasing market share becoming a significant load in distribution systems. An un-controlled charging of a large number of electric vehicles can potentially lead to problems in distribution circuits including low voltage levels and component overloads. These problems can be avoided by implementing a vehicle charging control scheme. This paper proposes a particle-swarm optimization-based method to centrally control vehicle charging on a neighborhood level. Vehicle charging is scheduled day-ahead for a given distribution system area while minimizing the total charging cost subject to grid and vehicle constraints. The proposed computationally efficient algorithm reduces the charging cost while enforcing voltage or line flow limits applying linear sensitivities. We demonstrate the method in a model of a real meshed 121-bus, 57-vehicle European low voltage distribution system.},

The algorithm is developed to be used by an aggregator, which may be a utility or a third party. This algorithm maximizes profits to the aggregator while providing additional system flexibility and peak load shaving to the utility and low costs of EV charging to the customer. The formulation also takes into account unplanned EV departures during the contract periods and compensates ac- cordingly.

The scheduler has access to past and current prices, but only statistical knowledge about future prices, which it uses to make an optimal decision in each time period. The scheduling problem is naturally cast as a Markov decision process. Algorithms to find decision thresholds for both noninterruptible and interruptible loads under a deadline constraint are then developed. Numerical results suggest that incorporating the statistical knowledge into the scheduling policies can result in significant savings, especially for short tasks. It is demonstrated with real price data from Commonwealth Edison that scheduling with mismatched modeling and online parameter estimation can still provide significant economic advantages to consumers.},

abstract = {Energy use in the home is a major source of carbon emissions and is highly dependent on the activities of the residents. More specifically, the timing of energy use, particularly electricity, is highly dependent on the timing of the occupants' activities. Thus, in order to model domestic demand profiles with high temporal resolution, for example, in the context of designing and assessing demand side management systems (including the time-shifting of demand), it is of great benefit to take account of residents' behaviour in terms of when they are likely to be using household appliances, lighting and heating. This paper presents a thorough and detailed method for generating realistic occupancy data for UK households, based upon surveyed time-use data describing what people do and when. The approach presented generates statistical occupancy time-series data at a ten-minute resolution and takes account of differences between weekdays and weekends. The model also indicates the number of occupants that are active within a house at a given time, which is important for example in order to model the sharing of energy use (shared use of appliances, etc.) The data from the model can be used as input to any domestic energy model that uses occupancy time-series as a base variable, or any other application that requires detailed occupancy data. The model has been implemented in Excel and is available for free download. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Three approaches were studied: dumb charging, dual tariff policy and smart charging. To assess the efficacy of such procedures, the grid integration of EVs was pushed to its limit for each of the adopted charging management approaches. A Medium Voltage (MV) grid, representative of a residential area distribution grid in Portugal, was used as testing environment. Several shares of EVs technologies were considered for different integration scenarios. Voltage profiles and branch congestion levels were evaluated, for the peak load hour, for grid technical limits checking. Losses were also evaluated for a typical daily load profile.},

This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover kW. Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3{\%} of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38{\%} of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind. Jurisdictions more likely to take the lead in adopting V2G are identified. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy trading in day-ahead electricity markets can be highly risky, especially for entities with considerable stochastic energy penetration. This is because of the uncertain energy prices, balancing prices, stochastic energy availability, and demand. In this work, coordinating unidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services with energy trading is proposed to mitigate these trading risks. This coordination is possible due to the recent advances in smart grid technologies. The case of a load-serving entity (LSE) that owns thermal and wind plants, and is obligated to serve a load with a significant number of electric vehicles (EVs) is investigated. The problem of energy trading in coordination with V2G services is formulated as a mixed-integer stochastic linear program. The objective is to maximize the LSE's profits while maintaining its risks within acceptable levels. The conditional value at risk is used as a risk control measure. A case study that compares coordinated vs. uncoordinated EV charging is presented. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of coordinating V2G services with other generation assets for the LSE and the EV owners as well as the impact of this coordination on the environment.},

The uncertainties associated with the residential loads, m-Gen and EV owners' behaviour, were addressed with a probabilistic approach.

@phdthesis{Galus2011,
abstract = {Due to a paradigm shift towards more sustainable socio-ecological energy systems, more and more distributed energy resources are integrated into power systems. This, together with the the liberalization of electric power systems, creates numerous challenges. Build and expanded during the last century, the power system was initially not designed to cope with large amounts of distributed energy resources, sometimes far away from load centers and with ﬂuctuating power infeed. An increased level of transnational electricity trading, one facette of the liberalization, leads to an increasing number of congestion of cross-border electricity lines. Recently, in order to transform the system into one that can stand up better to these challenges, the concept of Smart Grid gained momentum. While its exact deﬁnition is still to be formulated, among other goals, the introduction and integration of large scale electric mobility is one central issue. The beneﬁts of individual electric transportation feature an increased overall energy eﬃciency, especially if the vehicles are charged by renewable energy sources, and the possibility utilize the vehicles as a potential storage in power systems. However, the introduction of individual electric mobility on a large scale also poses numerous challenges to the power system infrastructure initially not designed to supply loads of unknown temporal and, even worse, spatial behavior. The vision of using the vehicles as a storage, which includes feeding power from the vehicles to the power system, commonly referred to as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, aggravates the complexity of the challenge. This thesis develops an agent based analysis tool in order to investigate the impacts of large scale electric vehicle adoption on power systems. The tool, beyond simple analysis measures, provides an agent based, intelligent charging control approach. It allows to operate the power system infrastructure close to its feasible capacity bounds while managing the demand of large numbers of vehicles. Uniquely, the tool integrates three major domains aﬀected by electric mobility. The domains include individual vehicle modeling, modeling of individual transportation behavior as well as modeling of power systems. Detailed energy consumption models for each individual vehicle and a ﬂeet evolution simulation are used as inputs to a large scale, agent based transportation simulation model. The output of the transportation simulation is used as input to the charging control scheme in the power system simulation. The scheme takes advantage of the vehicles charging ﬂexibility while supplying their energy demand. Additionally, it is also able to analyze and simulate the aggregation of the vehicles into a virtual storage and its temporal and spatial eﬀects on power systems. To this end, the control approach uses a distributed, predictive and hierarchical architecture, integrating diﬀerent charging modes such as uncontrolled and controlled charging as well as V2G services. The thesis contributes on the discussion of how such intelligent control approaches, notably the chosen one, can be integrated into current power system legal and operational frameworks. Finally, the thesis provides a proof of concept on how electric mobility can be advantageously integrated into power systems, illustrating how, based on today's power system structure, one pillar of the smart grid can become reality.},

In this work, the relationship between feeder losses, load factor, and load variance is explored in the context of coordinated PHEV charging. From these relationships, three optimal charging algorithms are developed which minimize the impacts of PHEV charging on the connected distribution system. The application of the algorithms to two test systems verifies these relationships approximately hold independent of system topology. They also show the additional benefits of reduced computation time and problem convexitywhen using load factor or load variance as the objective function rather than system losses. This is important for real-time dispatching of PHEVs.},

abstract = {Abstract The main impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging is adding new time-variant loads that can increase the strains on the generation units, transmission and distribution systems that may result in unacceptable voltage drops and poor power quality. This paper proposes two dynamic online approaches for coordination of PEV charging based on fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) and fuzzy discrete particle swarm optimization (FDPSO). The algorithms will minimize the costs associated with energy generation and grid losses while also maximizing the delivered power to PEVs considering distribution transformer loading, voltage regulation limits, initial and final battery state of charges (SOCs) based on consumers' preferences. The second algorithm relies on the quality and speed of DPSO solution for more accurate and faster online coordination of PEVs while also exploiting fuzzy reasoning for shifting charging demands to off-peak hours for a further reduction in overall cost and transformer loading. Simulation results for uncoordinated, DPSO, FGA and FDPSO coordinated charging are presented and compared for a 449-node network populated with PEVs. Results are also compared with the previously published PEV coordinated charging based on maximum sensitivity selections (MSS). Main contributions are formulating the PEVs charging coordination problem and applying different optimization methods including online FGA and FDPSO considering different driving patterns, battery sizes and charging rates, as well as initial SOCs and requested final SOCs.},

@article{Li2012,
abstract = {Millions of electric vehicles (EVs), especially plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), will be integrated into the power grid in the near future. Due to their large quantity and complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated. Since the charging behavior of PHEVs in a certain regional transmission network or a local distribution network is determined by different uncertain factors, their overall charging demand tends to be uncertain and in this situation probabilistic power flow (PPF) can be applied to analyze the impact of PHEVs charging on the power grid. However, currently there is no suitable model of the overall charging demand of PHEVs available for PPF calculations. In this paper, a methodology of modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs is proposed. The proposed methodology establishes a single PHEV charging demand model, and then employs queuing theory to describe the behavior of multiple PHEVs. Moreover, two applications are given, i.e., modeling the overall charging demand of PHEVs at an EV charging station and in a local residential community, respectively. Comparison between PPF calculations and Monte Carlo simulation are made on a modified IEEE 30-bus system integrated with the two demand models proposed.},

abstract = {Assessing the impact of domestic low-carbon technologies on the electricity distribution network requires a detailed insight into the operation of networks and the power demands of consumers. When used on a wide-scale, low-carbon technologies, including domestic scale micro-generation, heat pumps, electric vehicles and flexible demand, will change the nature of domestic electricity use. In providing a basis for the quantification of the impact upon distribution networks, this thesis details the construction and use of a high-resolution integrated model that simulates both existing domestic electricity use and low voltage distribution networks. Electricity demand is modelled at the level of individual household appliances and is based upon surveyed occupant time-use data. This approach results in a simulation that exhibits realistic time-variant demand characteristics, in both individual dwellings, as well as, groups of dwellings together. Validation is performed against real domestic electricity use data, measured for this purpose, from dwellings in Loughborough in the East Midlands, UK. The low voltage distribution network is modelled using real network data, and the output of its simulation is validated against measured network voltages and power demands. The integrated model provides a highly detailed insight into the operation of networks at a one-minute resolution. This integrated model is the main output of this research, alongside published articles and a freely downloadable software implementation of the demand model.},

In our work we model static residential electricity demand together with flexible electric vehicles (EVs) as charging loads. We develop a mixed-integer program to assess the ability of an EV fleet operator to coordinate charging in such a way that a maximum amount of renewable energy is used. Such coordinated charging still requires that all projected mobility needs are satisfied. EVs are modeled using empirical driving profiles of full time employees. Our results show that compared to uncoordinated immediate charging, an optimized charging schedule can nearly double the share of renewable energy used and achieve a yearly supply from wind power of up to 67.2{\%}. In addition, we find that coordinated charging decreases load peaks and reduces the amount of conventional generation required as backup capacity.},

abstract = {The vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system enables energy flow from the electric vehicles (EVs) to the grid. The distributed power of the EVs can either be sold to the grid or be used to provide frequency regulation service when V2G is implemented. A V2G control algorithm is necessary to decide whether the EV should be charged, discharged, or provide frequency regulation service in each hour. The V2G control problem is further complicated by the price uncertainty, where the electricity price is determined dynamically every hour. In this paper, we study the real-time V2G control problem under price uncertainty. We model the electricity price as a Markov chain with unknown transition probabilities and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This model features implicit estimation of the impact of future electricity prices and current control operation on long-term profits. The Q-learning algorithm is then used to adapt the control operation to the hourly available price in order to maximize the profit for the EV owner during the whole parking time. We evaluate our proposed V2G control algorithm using both the simulated price and the actual price from PJM in 2010. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can work effectively in the real electricity market and it is able to increase the profit significantly compared with the conventional EV charging scheme.},

It has brought electric vehicles back into the spotlight worldwide at a moment when fossil fuel prices were reaching unexpected high due to increased demand and strong economic growth. The energy storage capabilities from of fleets of electric vehicles as well as the potentially random discharging and charging offers challenges to the grid in terms of operation and control. Optimal scheduling strategies are key to integrating large numbers of electric vehicles and the smart grid. In this paper, state-of-the-art optimization methods are reviewed on scheduling strategies for the grid integration with electric vehicles. The paper starts with a concise introduction to analytical charging strategies, followed by a review of a number of classical numerical optimization methods, including linear programming, non-linear programming, dynamic programming as well as some other means such as queuing theory. Meta-heuristic techniques are then discussed to deal with the complex, high-dimensional and multi-objective scheduling problem associated with stochastic charging and discharging of electric vehicles. Finally, future research directions are suggested.},

abstract = {In response to the need for the decarbonization of the transport sector, it is expected that large fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) will constitute an important share of the electricity demand. This evolution is likely to be accompanied by a parallel evolution of the electricity supply business with the deployment of smart grid technologies. As a consequence, it is expected that demand will feature higher potential for communication and control, which will enable its active participation in the daily operational planning of power systems. In particular, EVs being equipped with a battery can both defer their demand or inject electricity back into the system. However, to achieve volumes that can have an impact on the system, these demands need to be aggregated and operated as an ensemble. This paper proposes the necessary adaptations to include the input of EV aggregation to electricity markets. This permits the scheduling of EV charging and services in coordination with the system operator thus enhancing the power system's efficiency and security while reducing its environmental impact. Results show that the EVs penetration levels that the system would be able to absorb without requiring expansion of the supply side, are significantly increased when coordination over their charging schedule is performed.},

abstract = {This study aims to build a database of load profiles for electric-drive vehicles (EDVs) based on car-use profiles of current conventional vehicles in six European countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom). Driving profiles were collected by means of sample travel surveys carried out in the six countries. The report presents the load profiles resulting from analysis of the travel survey data, and obtained by associating assumptions on technical features of EDVs with behavioural elements. The document explains in detail the methodology used and the assumptions adopted for the driving profiles estimation, discusses the results of scenarios for the six European countries, and presents an alternative scenario to assess how load profiles might change under different parameters. The load profiles, obtained from the scenario analysis, reveal that some differences between countries do exist; however, notably, the assumptions concerning when and where individuals can/want to recharge EDVs explain the amount of electricity demanded from the grid over time. Analysis of the scenarios confirms that uncontrolled recharging could lead to artificial electricity-demand spikes when certain time windows for lower tariffs exist network-wide. This can be prevented by means of controlled recharging supported by smart grids. It is worth mentioning at this point that the methodology applied in this study constitutes an intermediate step, taken before the field data from EDV users become available.},

abstract = {Grid-connected electrical storage has a high potential to support the transition toward a reliable decentralized and renewable energy supply. It is expected that lithium-ion batteries will play a major role in this transition, because of their high energy density and of the potential capacity that is offered by plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles. The use of lithium-ion batteries in grid support may result in additional degradation. Intelligent control of these batteries can assure that the additional degradation rate is minimized and their utilization is cost-effective. It is, therefore, imperative that the intelligent control has an excellent understanding of the aging behavior of the battery, therefore, it can maximize the benefits for the battery owner. Based on this logic, cycle life experiments were performed on lithium polymer cells in which the cell life dependence on the depth of discharge was investigated. Other cell characteristics that were studied include the equivalent series resistance and the efficiency.},

An Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) wind speed model forecasts the wind power output. Using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, EVs are grouped into 6 fleets of similar daily driving patterns. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in combination with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to optimize charging and discharging of the EVs. The optimization scheme minimizes the sum of the penalty cost associated with wind power imbalances and V2G expenses associated with purchased energy, battery wear and capital costs. The proposed method provides a collaborative strategy between the wind participants and EV owners to increase their revenues and incentives. A cost-benefit analysis assesses the economic feasibility of V2G services for wind power integration. The coordinated charging/discharging scheme optimally utilizes the V2G capacities of EVs and compensates for power imbalances due to random variations of wind power.},

This work proposes a Monte Carlo-based technique to assess the impacts of different PV penetrations on LV networks in order to estimate their corresponding hosting capabilities. Three-phase models of two real LV networks in the North West of England are studied considering 5-min resolution synthetic data for domestic load and PV generation. Voltage-related impacts are measured using the European Standard EN50160. Additionally, the importance of data granularity on the impact assessment is analyzed. Results for the studied LV networks indicate that feeders with greater lengths and larger number of customers tend to experience voltage issues with lower PV penetration levels. In terms of the granularity, it was found that hourly resolution analyses underestimate the voltage impacts of residential PV.},

abstract = {When preparing for the widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), an important issue is to use a proper EVs' charging/discharging scheduling model that is able to simultaneously consider economic and environmental goals as well as technical constraints of distribution networks. This paper proposes a multi-objective operational scheduling method for charging/discharging of EVs in a smart distribution system. The proposed multi-objective framework, based on augmented $\epsilon$-constraint method, aims at minimizing the total operational costs and emissions. The Vehicle to Grid (V2G) capability as well as the actual patterns of drivers are considered in order to generate the Pareto-optimal solutions. The Benders decomposition technique is used in order to solve the proposed optimization model and to convert the large scale mixed integer nonlinear problem into mixed-integer linear programming and nonlinear programming problems. The effectiveness of the proposed resources scheduling approach is tested on a 33-bus distribution test system over a 24-h period. The results show that the proposed EVs' charging/discharging method can reduce both of operation cost and air pollutant emissions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This Ph.D. thesis deals with the utilization of exible demand-side resources in the electric power system for the provision of ancillary services, emergency control functionalities, and the operational exibility that is crucial for the transition to a power system based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). A major part of the work is focused on modeling and control of large populations of Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) for heating and cooling applications. The principal objective of this research effort is to achieve a reliable setpoint tracking of the TCLs' aggregate power consumption without compromising the users' comfort. Tracking is achieved by using coordination algorithms on the device level which send switching signals to selected TCLs, or broadcast information that causes autonomous switching reactions by TCLs. The coordination algorithms used are 1) rule-based and 2) based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The aggregate State of Charge (SOC) of the TCL population can be de ned as a measure of internal TCL temperatures with respect to upper and lower temperature limits, indicating how much exibility the TCLs exhibit without becoming too hot or too cold. This enables the integration of the aggregate SOC in dispatch algorithms. The TCL populations coordinated by setpoint tracking algorithms are integrated into a supervisory dispatch framework which combines controllable loads, storage devices, and generation units in so-called Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). These exible portfolios of physically diverse units are mathematically represented by a novel modeling approach called Power Nodes Modeling Framework (PNMF). Various control services for power systems, e.g., least-cost dispatch, ramping reduction, and frequency control, are formulated and simulated using the PNMF. We use MPC for dispatching the portfolio using predictions of load and intermittent renewable energy as an input. xiii},

Nevertheless, the EV charging management problem of a parking station integrated with RES is challenging due to the uncertain nature of local RES generation. This paper aims to address these difficulties by deploying an energy storage system (ESS) in parking stations and exploiting the charging and discharging scheduling of EVs to achieve better utilization of intermittent PVS for EV charging. A real-time charging optimization scheme is also formulated, using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to coordinate the charging or discharging power of EVs along with the power dispatches of power grid and ESS based on the vehicles' charging or discharging priorities and electricity price preferences. Extensive simulations show that the proposed approach not only maximizes the satisfaction of EV owners in terms of fulfilling all charging and discharging requests, but also minimizes the overall operational cost of the parking station by prioritizing the utilization of energy from PVS, ESS, and scheduling of every EV's charging and discharging.},

abstract = {As an important component of Smart Grid, advanced plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are drawing much more attention because of their high energy efficiency, low carbon and noise pollution, and low operational cost. Unlike other controllable loads, PEVs can be connected with the distribution system anytime and anywhere according to the customers' preference. The uncertain parameters (e.g., charging time, initial battery state-of-charge, start/end time) associated with PEV charging make it difficult to predict the charging load. Therefore, the inherent uncertainty and variability of the PEV charging load have complicated the operations of distribution systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based power dispatch approach. The proposed objective functions minimize the operational cost while accommodating the PEV charging uncertainty. Case studies are performed on a modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed MPC-based power dispatch scheme. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {So far research on modelling the travelling patterns of electric vehicles (EVs) lacks technical depth since the variability of individual travel behaviour lack spatial and temporal disaggregated details - this data is needed by operators (DNOs) to assess EV impact at a low voltage level. Thus, it is essential to integrate issues concerning the mobility of EVs with the operational issues facing DNOs. This paper discusses how a bottom-up agent-based modelling (ABM) approach, addressing the mobility of EVs, can be combined with power flow studies at different levels of abstraction. From the DNOs perspective the fact that EVs can move around means loads disappear and may reappear at a different location, which has consequences on the power flows. Hence the data collected from the EV driving patterns are quantified to monitor the state of charge of the batteries. Subsequently, the output collected from the ABM simulations are applied to power system studies by incorporating its data into a time coordinated optimal power flow (TCOPF) program. An example proof-of-concept case study is showcased to demonstrate the relevance of the ABM paradigm and the effectiveness of the TCOPF solver when they are merged for a small network; in this fashion proving interoperability between the models. Preliminary results illustrate the valuable operational information utilities can obtain regarding optimal EV charging strategies when considering an ABM approach to represent EVs in power flow studies.},

abstract = {—Renewable energy and Electric Vehicles (EVs) are promising solutions for energy cost savings and emission reduction. However, integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid could be a difficult task, because of the generation source intermittency and inconsistency with energy usage. In this paper, we present results of our study on the problem of allocating energy from renewable sources to EVs in a cost efficient manner. We have assumed that the renewable energy supply is time variant and in many ways unpredictable. EVs' charging requests should be satis-fied within a specified time frame, which may incur a cost of drawing additional energy (possibly non-renewable energy) from the power grid if the renewable energy supply is not sufficient to meet the dead-lines and may also reduce energy efficiency. We have formulated a stochastic optimization problem based on queuing model to mini-mize the time average cost of using non-renewable energy sources. The proposed approach fully considers the individual charging rate limit and deadline of each EV. The Lyapunov optimization tech-nique is used to solve the problem. The developed dynamic control algorithm does not require knowledge of the statistical distribution of the time-varying renewable energy generation, EV charging demand, or extra energy pricing. Simulation results using different wind power generation profiles were performed and analyzed in the study. The results show that our EV charging scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization can reduce both charging cost and mean delay time of fulfilling EV charging requests.},

abstract = {In this paper, the basic functions of an electric vehicle charging service provider are described with a focus on the associated optimization problems. A novel method of planning the charging of electric drive vehicles including electricity grid constraints, both voltage and power, is shown. The method establishes an individual charging plan for each vehicle and avoids distribution grid congestion while satisfying the requirements of the individual vehicle owners. The concepts proposed in this paper are tested on a simulated electricity grid. It is shown that both power and voltage constraints due to electric vehicle charging can be avoided using the proposed method.},

abstract = {—This paper presents a recharging scheme for plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles. Despite their many advantages such as reducing carbon footprint, lower fuel cots, and high performance, uncoordinated recharging of electric vehicles in a high-penetration system can increase system peak load and create new peaks in the demand profile, hence reducing system reliability and operational integrity. To optimize electric vehicle recharging costs and prevent such reliability problems, a dynamic stochastic optimization method is proposed that formulates a stochastic linear programming approach taking into account load, electricity pricing, and renewable energy generation uncer-tainties, and solves the day-ahead problem in an offline fashion. A second online stage is also proposed that uses offline solutions, col-lects real-time system data, and adjusts recharging schedules to obtain a better recharging scheme once system uncertainties are revealed. The proposed method is robust to variations in different stochastic parameters, has a low communication requirement, and benefits both users and the power utility. Recharging system structure, data models, and mathematical formulation of the proposed method are presented. Results demonstrate that unlike other recharging schemes, the proposed method does not increase system peak, does not create new peaks, and fills the valleys of demand profile to optimize power system operations.},

The proposed method is based on the assignment of scores to PEVs through a fuzzy expert system.

The optimization problem of online PEV charging is defined as mixed-integer nonlinear programming. Simulation on a typical distribution network proves the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Results of the analysis indicate that for more critical PEVs, which have shorter parking duration and higher required charging time, the proposed solution outperforms in more robust energy delivery to the PEV and, accordingly, more satisfaction for the owner.},

abstract = {The introduction of distributed energy resources (DER) is leading to significant changes in the way in which power systems are planned, operated and maintained. DER includes many different types of technology, ranging from producers of electricity such as microgeneration units to consumers of electricity such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. High penetrations of these new technologies are introducing new challenges for power systems as existing electricity networks were not originally designed to accommodate them. This thesis investigates the potential impact of DER in distribution systems, in particular low voltage residential networks, in terms of end-user voltage levels and thermal loading of network equipment. Deterministic and stochastic methods are used to analyse low voltage residential test networks. Acceptable penetration levels of various DER technology are assessed while maintaining the network within permissible operating limits. A stochastic assessment of the network with various penetration levels of DER is also performed to incorporate a number of the uncertainties associated with DER, such as time-of-use and energy requirements. In order to accommodate high penetrations of DER on existing low voltage distribution networks, a method for controlling their operation in a coordinated manner is proposed. The method controls the operation of DER units in order to fully utilise the available capacity of the network while maintaining acceptable operating limits. While the method is applicable to other forms of DER, electric vehicle technology is chosen to demonstrate the potential benefits. The technique is based on linear programming and determines the optimal charging rate for each electric vehicle in order to maximise the total power that can be delivered to all of the vehicles. The results show that high penetrations of electric vehicles can be accommodated on existing residential networks, thereby avoiding unnecessary network upgrades. The method for controlling DER operation described above is based on a centralised control scheme where a third-party operator has real-time knowledge of operating con- ditions at all points of the network. Implementing such a scheme would require a significant investment in communication infrastructure in order for the controller to receive and transmit charging rate commands to all electric vehicles on the network. As such, a distributed control technique is proposed whereby individual electric vehicle charging units attempt to maximise the charging rate for their vehicle while maintaining local network conditions within acceptable limits. The method would require less com- munications infrastructure than the centralised control method. Results demonstrate that the method is not as accurate as the centralised control technique at maintaining the network within acceptable operating limits and that distributed control charging schemes may only be sufficient for dealing with lower penetrations of electric vehicles or other forms of DER},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider delay-optimal charging scheduling of the electric vehicles (EVs) at a charging station with multiple charge points. The charging station is equipped with renewable energy generation devices and can also buy energy from power grids. The uncertainty of the arrival of the EV, the intermittence of the renewable energy, and the variation of the grid power price are taken into account and described as independent Markov processes. Meanwhile, the required charging energy for each EV is random. The goal is to minimize the mean waiting time for EVs under the long-term constraint on the cost. We propose queue mapping to convert the EV queue to the charging demand queue, and we prove the equivalence between the minimization of the two queues' average length. Then, we focus on the minimization for the average length of the charging demand queue under the long-term cost constraint. We propose a framework of Markov decision process (MDP) to investigate this constrained stochastic optimization problem. The system state includes the charging demand queue length, the charging demand arrival, the energy level in the storage battery of the renewable energy, the renewable energy arrival, and the grid power price. Additionally, the number of charging demands and the allocated energy from the storage battery compose the 2-D policy. We derive two necessary conditions of the optimal policy. Moreover, we discuss the reduction of the 2-D policy to be the number of charging demands only. We give the sets of system states for which charging no demand and charging as many demands as possible are optimal, respectively. Finally, we investigate the proposed policies numerically.},

Three electric mobility studies in Germany's southwestern region (Get eReady, iZEUS, and CROME) deliver comprehensive data of EV use for this purpose. In this paper we analyze and discuss the mobility and charging characteristics of this data in detail. We derive empirical EV load profiles and show how they are affected by charging management. We present a model to simulate EV loads based on statistical characteristics of the conducted studies. The resulting charging load profiles show similar patterns as other EV studies. The developed simulation model and its results (see supplementary data available online) allow a realistic representation of EV demand in analyses of future energy systems.},

abstract = {An economically efficient day-ahead tariff (DT) is proposed with the purpose of preventing distribution grid congestion resulting from electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduled on a day-ahead basis. The DT concept developed herein is derived from the locational marginal price (LMP), in particular the congestion cost component of the LMP. A step-wise congestion management structure has been developed whereby the distribution system operator (DSO) predicts congestion for the coming day and publishes DTs prior to the clearing of the day-ahead market. EV fleet operators (FOs) optimize their EV charging schedules with respect to the predicted day-ahead prices and the published DTs, thereby avoiding congestion while still minimizing the charging cost. A Danish 400 V distribution network is used to conduct case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed concept for the prevention of distribution grid congestion from EV charging. The case study results show that the concept is successful in a number of situations, most notably a predicted system overload of 155{\%} can be successfully alleviated on the test distribution network. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this work an optimal combined bidding formulation for regulation and spinning reserves is developed to be used by aggregators. This formulation takes into account unplanned departures by EV owners during contract periods and compensates accordingly. Optional load level and price constraints are also developed. These algorithms maximize profits to the aggregator while increasing the benefits the customers and utility. Simulations over a three month period on the ERCOT system show that implementation of these algorithms can provide significant benefits to customers, utilities, and aggregators. Comparisons with bidirectional V2G show that while the benefits of unidirectional V2G are significantly lower, so are the risks.},

abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are promoted as a viable near-term vehicle technology to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional vehicles (CVs). In spite of the benefits of EVs, several obstacles need to be overcome before EVs will be widely adopted. A major barrier is that consumers tend to resist new technologies that are considered alien or unproved, thus, policy decisions that consider their critical concerns will have a higher level of success. This research identifies potential socio-technical barriers to consumer adoption of EVs and determines if sustainability issues influence consumer decision to purchase an EV. This study provides valuable insights into preferences and perceptions of technology enthusiasts; individuals highly connected to technology development and better equipped to sort out the many differences between EVs and CVs. This group of individuals will likely be early adopters of EVs only if they perceive them to be superior in performance compared to CVs. These results can guide policymakers in crafting energy and transportation policy. It can also provide guidance to EV engineers' decision in incorporating consumer preference into EV engineering design. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing adoption of domestic photo- voltaic (PV) systems, the use of technologies such as on-load tap changer (OLTC)-fitted transformers, capacitor banks, and remote monitoring are being considered to mitigate voltage issues, partic- ularly in European-style low voltage (LV) networks. Depending on the control strategy, however, the effects on customer voltages and control actions (e.g., tap changes or capacitor switching) can vary significantly. This work presents a framework to assess the performance of different OLTC-based control strategies in terms of voltage compliance with the standard BS EN50160 and the number of control actions. Three control strategies are proposed: constant set-point (CSC), time-based (TBC) and remote moni- toring-based (RMC). A week-longMonte Carloanalysisiscarried out considering a real UK LV network, three-phase power flows, different PV penetrations and seasonality. Results show that the TBC outperforms the CSC but at the expense of more tap changes. Due to the enhanced visibility, theRMC significantly increases the PV hosting capacity whilst limiting tap operations. Finally, when feeders have contrasting voltage issues, capacitor banks are found to provide additional flexibility and allow higher PV penetrations. These findings are expected to help the industry determining the benefits from OLTC-based solutions in future LV networks.},

abstract = {To reduce the uncertain influence of wind power and solar photovoltaic power on virtual power plant (VPP) operation, robust optimization theory (ROT) is introduced to build a stochastic scheduling model for VPP considering the uncertainty, price-based demand response (PBDR) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR). First, the VPP components are described including the wind power plant (WPP), photovoltaic generators (PV), convention gas turbine (CGT), energy storage systems (ESSs) and demand resource providers (DRPs). Then, a scenario generation and reduction frame is proposed for analyzing and simulating output stochastics based on the interval method and the Kantorovich distance. Second, a bi-level robust scheduling model is proposed with a double robust coefficient for WPP and PV. In the upper layer model, the maximum VPP operation income is taken as the optimization objective for building the scheduling model with the day-ahead prediction output of WPP and PV. In the lower layer model, the day-ahead scheduling scheme is revised with the actual output of the WPP and PV under the objectives of the minimum system net load and the minimum system operation cost. Finally, the independent micro-grid in a coastal island in eastern China is used for the simulation analysis. The results illustrate that the model can overcome the influence of uncertainty on VPP operations and reduce the system power shortage cost by connecting the day-ahead scheduling with the real-time scheduling. ROT could provide a flexible decision tool for decision makers, effectively addressing system uncertainties. ESSs could replace CGT to provide backup service for the WPP and PV, to smooth the VPP output curve and to improve the WPP and PV grid connection by its charging-discharging characteristics. Meanwhile, IBDR and PBDR could smooth the load curve to the maximum extent, link the generation side with the demand side to minimize abandoned power value and reach the optimum benefit of VPP operation.},

The burden falls to an independent system operator (ISO) to ensure that enough ancillary services (AS) are available for safe, stable, and reliable operation of the grid, typically defined, in part, as compliance with officially approved engineering specifications for minimum levels of AS. In order to characterize the behavior of market participants (generators, retailers, and an ISO) in a competitive electricity market with reliability requirements, spot markets for both electricity and AS are modeled. By assuming that each participant seeks to maximize its wealth and that all markets clear, we solve for the optimal quantities of electricity and AS traded in the spot market by all participants, as well as the market clearing prices for each.},

The smart coordination of EV demand addresses an improvement in the flexibility of power systems and reduces the costs of power system investment. The uncertainty in EV drivers' behaviour is one of the main problems to solve to obtain an optimal integration of EVs into power systems. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm to coordinate the charging of EVs has been developed and implemented using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), where thermal line limits, the load on transformers, voltage limits and parking availability patterns are taken into account to establish an optimal load pattern for EV charging-based reliability. This methodology has been applied to an existing residential low-voltage system. The results indicate that a smart charging schedule for EVs leads to a flattening of the load profile, peak load shaving and the prevention of the aging of power system elements.},

First, an optimized charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost. Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern.

The electric vehicles are allowed to be recharged fully or partially at any of the given recharging stations. The objective is to firstly minimize the number of vehicles needed to cover all the timetabled trips, and secondly to minimize the total traveling distance, which is equivalent to minimizing the total deadheading distance. A mixed integer programming formulation as well as an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for the E-VSP are presented. ALNS is tested on newly generated E-VSP benchmark instances. Result shows that the proposed heuristic can provide good solutions to large E-VSP instances and optimal or near-optimal solutions to small E-VSP instances.},

Electrical mobility means the usage of battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) as the main future technology to combat greenhouse gas emissions. The burden of electric mobility will be mainly on the distribution system that, particularly during the peak hours, will be exposed to critical operation conditions by a high number of high density simultaneous loads. Vehicle-to-Grid technology by adding control capabilities to charge and discharge of cars' batteries can exalt the benefits from their whole energy storage capacity. Distributors can then be helped in the active management of the network by the services offered (e.g., VAR/volt regulation, frequency regulation, spinning reserve, integration of renewable generation). Vehicle-to-Grid is perfectly part of the emerging Smart Grid technology and is based on intelligent stations fully integrated within the distribution management system. For a full exploitation of Vehicle-to-Grid potentialities, the role of the aggregator is essential to create value to customers by offering services to the distribution system operator. In the paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization is used to define the aggregator's optimal control strategy to optimize the recharge/discharge patterns of a fleet of EVs taking into account financial contracts, driver's behavior, energy prices, etc.},

PEVs are mobile and distributed devices with deferrable options for the supply/uti- lization of energy at various times and locations. The increased utilization of PEVs, which consume electricity rather than fossil fuel for driving, offers unique economic and environmental oppor- tunities, and brings out new challenges to electric power system operation and planning. The storage capability of PEVs could help power systems mitigate the variability of renewable energy sources and reduce grid operation costs. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables PEVs to have bi-directional power flows once they are connected to the grid, i.e., they can either inject power to, and draw power from, the grid which adds further complexity to power system operations. PEVs signify customers' random behavior when con- sidering their driving patterns, locational energy requirements, topological grid interconnections, and other constraints imposed by the consumers. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for analyzing the impact of PEVs on the grid operation cost and hourly wind energy dispatch.},

The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The future energy system in Denmark will most likely be based on renewable energy sources e.g. wind and solar power. These green energy sources introduce stochastic fluctuations in the electricity production. Therefore, energy should be consumed as soon as it is produced to avoid the need for energy storage as this is expensive, limited and introduces efficiency losses. The Economic MPC for EVs described in this paper may contribute to facilitating transition to a fossil free energy system.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the classification of electricity customers on the basis of their electrical behavior. Starting from an extensive field measurement-based database of customer daily load diagrams, the authors searched for the most appropriate indices or sets of indices to be used for customer classification. They propose two original measures to quantify the degree of adequacy of each index. Using the indices as distinguishing features, they adopt an automatic clustering algorithm to form customer classes. Each customer class is then represented by its load profile. They use the load profiles to study the margins left to a distribution company for fixing dedicated tariffs to each customer class. They take into account new degrees of freedom available in the competitive electricity markets, which increase flexibility in the tariff definition under imposed revenue caps. Results of a case study performed on a set of customers of a large distribution company are presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for modeling and analyzing the load demand in a distribution system due to electric vehicle (EV) battery charging. Following a brief introduction to the common types of EV batteries and their charging characteristics, an analytical solution for predicting the EV charging load is developed. The method is stochastically formulated so as to account for the stochastic nature of the start time of individual battery charging and the initial battery state-of-charge. A comparative study is carried out by simulating four EV charging scenarios, i.e., uncontrolled domestic charging, uncontrolled off-peak domestic charging, {\&}{\#}x201C;smart{\&}{\#}x201D; domestic charging and uncontrolled public charging{\&}{\#}x2014;commuters capable of recharging at the workplace. The proposed four EVs charging scenarios take into account the expected future changes to the electricity tariffs in the electricity market place and appropriate regulation of EVs battery charging loads. A typical U.K. distribution system is adopted as an example. The time-series data of EV charging loads is taken from two commercially available EV batteries: lead-acid and lithium-ion. Results show that a 10{\%} market penetration of EVs in the studied system would result in an increase in daily peak demand by up to 17.9{\%}, while a 20{\%} level of EV penetration would lead to a 35.8{\%} increase in peak load, for the scenario of uncontrolled domestic charging{\&}{\#}x2014;the {\&}{\#}x201C;worst-case{\&}{\#}x201D; scenario.},

V2G frameworks require that the utility company or a third party aggregator has access to each vehicle's charging status via a two-way communication network for billing and planning purposes. We establish that there exist consumer privacy risks associated with current concepts for V2G implementation and argue that consumer preferences and behaviors can be inferred from charging information if privacy is not a primary concern from the outset of V2G design.

However, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles could lead to adverse effects on the power system, especially for existing distribution networks. These effects would include excessive voltage drops and overloading of network components, which occur mainly during periods of simultaneous charging of large numbers of electric vehicles. This paper demonstrates how controlling the rate at which electric vehicles charge can lead to better utilization of existing networks. A technique based on linear programming is employed, which determines the optimal charging rate for each electric vehicle in order to maximize the total power that can be delivered to the vehicles while operating within network limits. The technique is tested on a section of residential distribution network. Results show that, by controlling the charging rate of individual vehicles, high penetrations can be accommodated on existing residential networks with little or no need for upgrading network infrastructure},

abstract = {Since a possibility for grid-side use of electric-drive vehicles was first claimed, regulation has been proved to be most feasible service by many earlier studies. Moreover, with the emergence of Plug-in HEV, an actual introduction of the regulation service is getting more realistic. To launch the practical service, however, the development of a smart control interface called an aggregator between the grid and the vehicles should be preceded. The main role of the aggregator is, as the name indicates, to synchronize the charge and the discharge operations of multiple vehicles to provide significant amount of power capacity for the regulation service. Consequently, the aggregator has to hold the control of each vehicle. Meanwhile, from the perspective of a vehicle owner, the primary goal of plugging the vehicle into the grid is charging the battery to serve next drive. Since a vehicle that joined the regulation is following the command from the aggregator, it is also the responsibility of the aggregator to perform the desired amount of battery charging. Therefore, the aggregator should have an appropriate strategy to provide regulation service while performing battery charging. In this paper, we assess various aspects of the aggregator, and develop an optimal control strategy for the aggregator regarding a performance measure. Finally, proprieties of the suggested aggregator are verified with simulations.},

abstract = {A gridable vehicle (GV) can be used as a small portable power plant (S3P) to enhance the security and reliability of utility grids. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has drawn great interest in the recent years and its success depends on intelligent scheduling of GVs or S3Ps in constrained parking lots. V2G can reduce dependencies on small expensive units in existing power systems, resulting in reduced operation cost and emissions. It can also increase reserve and reliability of existing power systems. Intelligent unit commitment (UC) with V2G for cost and emission optimization in power system is presented in this paper. As number of gridable vehicles in V2G is much higher than small units of existing systems, UC with V2G is more complex than basic UC for only thermal units. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to balance between cost and emission reductions for UC with V2G. PSO can reliably and accurately solve this complex constrained optimization problem easily and quickly. In the proposed solution model, binary PSO optimizes on/off states of power generating units easily. Vehicles are presented by integer numbers instead of zeros and ones to reduce the dimension of the problem. Balanced hybrid PSO optimizes the number of gridable vehicles of V2G in the constrained parking lots. Balanced PSO provides a balance between local and global searching abilities, and finds a balance in reducing both operation cost and emission. Results show a considerable amount of cost and emission reduction with intelligent UC with V2G. Finally, the practicality of UC with V2G is discussed for real-world applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) technologies create the opportunity to enhance energy service networks by coordinating these small-scale devices under various dispatch schemes. Furthermore, if vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and thermal storage features are considered, these embedded technologies could have even a greater impact on network performance. Therefore, this work presents a holistic modelling framework which serves as a tool to optimise in a coordinated manner the operation of natural gas and electrical infrastructures under the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). The modelling tool developed, under the name TCOPF, is a decision maker entity that aggregates and coordinates the available DERs according to utility conditions. As a consequence, the tool functions by employing an integrated time coordinated electric and natural gas optimal power ow. Hence, once the results are analysed, the output allows stakeholders to identify techno-economical tradeo s that might be encountered by applying particular operating strategies and load control approaches. To illustrate the value of the modelling tool, a case study is assessed by evaluating di erent objective functions which simulate diverse operating strategies of utilities. The examples prove the TCOPF acts as an ecient intermediary entity that manages cost-e ective interactions between the connected technologies and the distribution network operators (DNOs). Results show considerable bene ts in operating electrical networks while simultaneously having mild e ects in natural gas networks. Furthermore, the modelling tool describes the optimal dispatch patterns distributed energy resources should follow in order to improve the performance of urban energy service networks. Thus, the TCOPF program o ers a fresh perspective for stakeholders wishing to successfully integrate and coordinate in a seamlessly fashion the operation of distributed energy resources with the operating strategies of energy utilities.},

While much work has been done to detail what economic costs and benefits PHEVs will have on consumers and producers alike, it seems that it is also important to understand what impact PHEVs will have on distribution networks nationwide. This paper finds that the impact of PHEVs on the distribution network can be determined using the following aspects of PHEVs: driving patterns, charging characteristics, charge timing, and vehicle penetration. The impacts that these aspects of PHEVs will have on distribution networks have been measured and calculated by multiple authors in different locations using many different tools that range from analytical techniques to simulations and beyond. While much work has already been completed in this area, there is still much to do. Areas left for improvement and future work will include adding more stochasticity into models as well as computing and analyzing reliability indices with respect to distribution networks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition towards very high shares of fluctuating energy generation sources requires significant changes to the power system and electricity markets. Smart grids will play a key role in addressing this challenge. Through improved monitoring, forecasting and control capabilities they will be able to empower the so far passive demand side of the power system. Yet, the successful establishment of smart grids will require both sound technical and economic concepts. The economic anal- ysis of smart grid capabilities needs to incorporate physical boundaries as hard con- straints which need to be facilitated by means of flexibility potentials and intelligent dispatching. Due to the distributed nature of demand, economic coordination also needs to be able to facilitate a multitude of individual agents. Consequently, the design of future power systems and electricity markets needs to embrace the im- portance of distributed agents and facilitate their integration. The thesis follows this decentral and demand-centric vision of the smart grid. Questions concerning the modeling and coordination of an active demand side are addressed using tools and techniques from information systems and economics. Building on a framework for the design of smart grid customer models relevant coordination approaches are discussed. This framework is applied within two distinct application scenarios — household customer models and electric vehicle models. Household customer models are derived by applying a cluster analysis to iden- tify customer segments within smart metering data from a regional utilities com- pany. This data mining approach reveals distinct customer segments which differ from standard load profiles. The customer heterogeneity motivates the design of customer-specific electricity rates. To this end, a mixed-integer optimization model to determine efficient time-of-use electricity rates for individual customer segments is proposed and evaluated. It obtains that rate update frequency is of greater impor- tance than rate granularity. Charging needs of electric vehicles are modeled using current technical speci- fications and empirical mobility data. Based on these model primitives, a variety of decision models encapsulating different price and trip information regimes are discussed and implemented. This allows assessing likely charging behavior of indi- vidual electric vehicles in the presence of different incentive schemes, battery wear or load-based demand charges. These individual models are then aggregated to analyze the load impact of population-wide charging behavior. Based on these population models, two charging load coordination mechanisms are discussed — locational pricing and capacity management. Using surcharges reflecting local trans- former utilization, area pricing successfully mitigates violations of stability limits while retaining the economic incentives of load shifting. The capacity management scheme can achieve similar coordination results using a non-price-based approach. Describing novel modeling techniques and coordination approaches, this thesis contributes to the energy informatics literature and aims at establishing a notion of smart grid market design.},

abstract = {The ability to determine optimal charging profiles of electric vehicles (EVs) is paramount in developing an efficient and reliable smart-grid. However, so far the level of analysis proposed to address this issue lacks combined spatial and temporal elements, thus making mobility a key challenge to address for a proper representation of this problem. This paper details the principles applied to represent optimal charging of EVs by employing an agent-based model that simulates the travelling patterns of vehicles on a road network. The output data is used as a reliable forecast so an optimal power flow model can devise optimal charging scenarios of EVs in a local electrical network. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by presenting a multi-day case study in an urban area. Results show a high level of detail and variability in EV charging when a present-day carbon fuel mix is compared to one with lower carbon intensity.},

abstract = {The widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs) is becoming an imminent trend. Research has been done on the scheduling of EVs from the perspective of the charging characteristic, improvement in the safety and economy of the power grid, or the traffic jams in the transport system caused by a large number of EVs driven to charging stations. There is a lack of systematic studies considering EVs, the power grid, and the transport system all together. In this paper, a novel optimal charging scheduling strategy for different types of EVs is proposed based on not only transport system information, such as road length, vehicle velocity and waiting time, but also grid system information, such as load deviation and node voltage. In addition, a charging scheduling simulation platform suitable for large-scale EV deployment is developed based on actual charging scenarios. The simulation results show that the improvements in both the transport system efficiency and the grid system operation can be obtained by using the optimal strategy, such as the node voltage drop is decreased, the power loss is reduced, and the load curve is optimized.},

abstract = {With the introduction of restructuring into the electric power industry, the price of electricity has become the focus of all activities in the power market. Electricity price forecast is key information for electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets. Our forecast strategy is composed of a new two stage feature selection technique and cascaded neural networks. The proposed feature selection technique comprises modified Relief algorithm for the first stage and correlation analysis for the second stage. The modified Relief algorithm selects candidate inputs with maximum relevancy with the target variable. Then among the selected candidates, the correlation analysis eliminates redundant inputs. Selected features by the two stage feature selection technique are used for the forecast engine, which is composed of 24 consecutive forecasters. Each of these 24 forecasters is a neural network allocated to predict the price of 1 h of the next day. The whole proposed forecast strategy is examined on the Spanish and Australia's National Electricity Markets Management Company (NEMMCO) and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods.

abstract = {Transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is already under way. EVs are equipped with a drive train that is completely electric powered, with a fairly large on-board battery pack. More recently, EVs have been looked at as distributed sources of energy, whereby they could back up the power grid during critical high demand periods. With the help of an on-board battery pack, EVs can act as distributed generators and feedback energy to the AC grid. However, efficiency of energy conversion could become an issue in this power flow. Hence, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power flow requires a detailed stage-by-stage efficiency analysis, to evaluate practical feasibility. This paper aims at introducing some of the issues in connecting battery-powered EVs to the electricity grid. The paper highlights few of the inefficiencies of V2G connection, especially from the point of view of power electronics converter energy conversion stages, and suggests some research directions for the near future, in order to possibly make V2G a practical reality.},

abstract = {Vehicle to grid (V2G) provides an opportunity for the electric vehicles (EVs) to feed back their power to the electric grid as they are connected to the grid and not in use. However, during the charging period of these vehicles, the power is drawn from the electric grid to charge the battery. This paper examines the V2G capability of the EV fleet for its potential for synergies between the storage of the fleet and the intermittent nature of wind resources. Towards this end, a distribution feeder is considered with the wind power as its primary resource. Assuming an EV with V2G for each residence, different scenarios are studied to evaluate the capability of the EV fleet as the wind electric storage. An energy management method based on an evolutionary optimization approach is proposed to minimize the cost of the conventional generation required to supplement the wind power while maximizing the utilization of wind generation. Smart grid technologies such as real-time communication, smart metering and home area networks (HANs) are proposed to enhance the V2G capability for coordinated charging and discharging of the EV fleet in a distribution feeder. Flexibility of the system is assessed for the studied scenarios and the most appropriate solution is determined based on simulation results.},

Then, a heuristic method is implemented to minimize the charging cost considering the relation between the acceptable charging power of EV battery and the state of charge (SOC). Finally, the charging cost and energy demand in different time intervals are compared for both typical charging pattern and optimized charging pattern. Results show that the optimized charging pattern has great benefitinreducing costand flatting the load curve if the peak and valley time periods are partitioned appropriately.},

First, realistic 5-min time-series daily profiles are produced for photovoltaic panels, electric heat pumps, electric vehicles, and micro combined heat and power units. Then, to cater for the uncertainties of LCTs (e.g., size, location, and behavior), a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out considering 100 simulations for different penetration levels (percentage of houses with a LCT). This methodology is applied to 128 real U.K. LV feeders showing that about half of them can have voltage and/or congestion issues at some penetration of LCTs. Furthermore, to identify the relationships between the first occurrence of problems and key feeder parameters (e.g., length, number of customers), a correlation analysis is developed per LCT. Crucially, these results can be translated into lookup tables to help distribution network operators in producing preliminary estimates of the LCT hosting capacity of a given feeder.},

Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues.Bidi- rectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the elec- tric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience),Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed.

Nevertheless, due to the stochastic nature of the drivers' behavior and market variables, forecasting and optimization algorithms are necessary for supporting an EV aggregator participating in the electricity market. This paper describes a new day-ahead optimization model between energy and secondary reserve bids and an operational management algorithm that coordinates EV charging in order to minimize differences between contracted and realized values. The use of forecasts for EV and market prices is included, as well as a market settlement scheme that includes a penalty term for reserve shortage. The optimization framework is evaluated in a test case constructed with synthetic time series for EV and market data from the Iberian electricity market. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles can provide power to the electric grid when they are parked (vehicle-to-grid power). We evaluated the economic potential of two utility-owned fleets of battery-electric vehicles to provide power for a specific electricity market, regulation, in four US regional regulation services markets. The two battery-electric fleet cases are: (a) 100 Th!nk City vehicle and (b) 252 Toyota RAV4. Important variables are: (a) the market value of regulation services, (b) the power capacity (kW) of the electrical connections and wiring, and (c) the energy capacity (kWh) of the vehicle's battery. With a few exceptions when the annual market value of regulation was low, we find that vehicle-to-grid power for regulation services is profitable across all four markets analyzed. Assuming now more than current Level 2 charging infrastructure (6.6 kW) the annual net profit for the Th!nk City fleet is from US{\$} 7000 to 70,000 providing regulation down only. For the RAV4 fleet the annual net profit ranges from US{\$} 24,000 to 260,000 providing regulation down and up. Vehicle-to-grid power could provide a significant revenue stream that would improve the economics of grid-connected electric-drive vehicles and further encourage their adoption. It would also improve the stability of the electrical grid. ?? 2007.},
