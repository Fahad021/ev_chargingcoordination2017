%%   ABOUT
%%
%% This is the driver file for a Latex2e template which corresponds to the
%% regulations regarding layout of a thesis submitted within the University
%% of Edinburgh school of Engineering. It is not `official', but conforms
%% as best as possible to the regulation as detailed at:
%%
%% http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/science-engineering/current-students/
%% research/submitting-thesis

%% Please feel free to alter the template to your own liking, but note that

%%   CREDITS
%%
%% This template is an amalgamtion of an existing Edinburgh University,
%% Electrical Engineering PhD Thesis class file (jthesis-v1.cls) authored by
%% George S Taylor which was released under the GNU GPL.
%% Code is included from the dmathesis class Written by M. Imran
%% for a thesis according to the university of Durham regulation, which was
%% released without copyright. It also contains ideas (possibly code) from the
%% Princeton thesis class file (PrincetonThesis.cls), authored by Mike Nolta.
%% Mathew Topper, Eoghan Maguire and Bill Edwards forsaw the need to maintain a
%% more recent latex implementation of the thesis regulations and thus, this
%% project was born. It is hoped that the template will be maintained by the
%% Edinburgh Engineering PhD community once released.

%%     ====      ==========         =====================
%%   21/06/10    Mathew Topper      First Try.
%%
%%   22/06/10                       Removed pdf option in favour of
%%                                  ifpdf package.
%%
%%   23/06/10                       Can now include appendix files
%%                                  rather than input. Need to include
%%                                  the file appendix/edengapp.tex
%%
%%                                  Added includeonly command.
%%
%%   13/10/10                       Removed the input of packages.tex
%%                                  this is now dealt with in the class
%%                                  file.
%%
%%   20/10/10                       Added 'nobib' option to stop the
%%                                  bibliography being printed and now
%%                                  the frontmatter is also entered in 
%%                                  an include statement.
%%
%%   29/10/10                       Added 'hyper' option to use hyperref
%%                                  to add clickable links.
%%
%%   04/04/11                       Set a qualification command to set
%%                                  a custom qualification on the front
%%                                  page.
%%
%%                                  Added 'nomencl' option to use the
%%                                  nomencl package to build a nomenclature.
%%                                  You need to run ./makenomencl.sh to build
%%                                  the nomenclature in linux
%%
%%   19/04/13                       Added some commented ``part'' definitions
%%

\documentclass[11pt,twoside,nopardent,notitlepage,fancychap,hyper]{edengths}

%% Class options go in the square brackets above
%% i.e. \documentclass[options]{edengths}

%% Default report class options are:
%% (These are automatically included)
%%
%% a4paper
%% openright - Start chapters on righthand side pages
%% titlepage - Title should be on it's own page
%%


%% Standard available report class options are:
%%
%% 10pt
%% 11pt
%% 12pt
%% draft
%% final
%% fleqno
%% leqno
%% oneside
%% twoside

%% edengths class specific options:
%%
%% subsubnos - Enable numbering of subsubsections (note: these don't
%%             appear in the contents)
%% nosans    - Don't use the sans serif headers and captions
%% nopardent - Remove paragraph indent and add a line skip
%% msfonts   - Use MS fonts rather than latex default
%% fancychap - Use fancy chapter headings like jthesis
%% crest     - Use a crest on the front page
%% labels    - Print labels in spine margin.
%% nobib     - do not print the bibliography
%% hyper     - Use the hyperref package to put clickable links into 
%%             the document. Use \autoref{fig:example} now instead of,
%%             say, figure~\ref{fig:example}. Settings are in
%%             edengfmt.tex.
%% nomencl   - Use the nomencl package. Example of it's usage are in
%%             front/nomencl.tex. The Nomenclature is called from
%%             front/frontmatr.tex

%% ADDITIONAL FORMATTING can be done in 'edengfmt.tex' where the page
%% dimensions, header/footers, table of contents and the names of 
%% the bibliography and other formatting settings can be altered.
%% IN PARTICULAR THE LINE SPACING IS SET IN 'edengfmt.tex' AND
%% THE HYPERREF OPTIONS ARE SET HERE TOO. THIS SETS THE NAME OF
%% THE PDF, FOR EXAMPLE.

%% The class file should automatically detect pdflatex and provide
%% the right options.

My deepest appreciation goes to my supervisor Dr. Wei Sun for his time and guidance on this project. Your feedback has encouraged me to explore new pathways. I am further indebted to my examiner Dr. Quan Li for taking the time to listen to my initial ideas and concerns on the scope of the project as well as for taking on the responsibility of assessing my work. A big shout out also to my companions Kelvin, Claudina, Farid, Conrad, Tony, Pablo and all the others of the Sustainable Energy Systems cohort for inspiration and friendship. You are fun to be around! Ultimately, thank you as well to my parents for heartfelt moral support and the constant link to home.

At last, some housekeeping. To enable fellow researches to benefit from my work and modify the experiments or algorithms to complement my findings, the simulation environment was uploaded into a public GitHub repository which can be found here:

\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/orley-enterprises/ev_chargingcoordination2017}
\end{center}

Guidance on installation and usage are provided. To spare a long appendix, all the necessary information to reproduce and check the conducted experiments are either included in the main body of this dissertation or complemented online, ready to run or download. I would sincerely appreciate further usage of the simulation tool and am happy to answer any queries via \href{mailto:fabian.neumann@outlook.de}{email}.
